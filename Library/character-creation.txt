Character Creation
==================

Firstly, don't worry too much about getting your character sheet right at character creation, I am happy for players to tweak it later.

Below are some character creation rules. In addition, I will be making example characters, some based off these rules and some weirder; and feel free to talk to me if you have a character concept you want to try.

Point budget
------------

Your characters in this campaign start as 75-point characters, where 25 of those points are earmarked for magical abilities.

Your characters are assumed to have settled lifestyles with ordinary jobs and hobbies, take some time to think about what skills might be useful for adventuring and an ordinary job.
Admittedly, short of being a professional athlete or martial arts instructor, combat skills aren't part of your job.

e.g.
* Savoir-Faire (Servant) is useful for customer service jobs, and also lets you infiltrate a place by impersonating service staff.
* Research is useful for a librarian or academic, and also useful for looking stuff up.

Your point spending rules are:
* Point budget of 50 points to be spent freely
* -50 points of Disadvantages
* -5 points of Quirks
* A total of 105 points can be spent in attributes, advantages and skills
* Up to 5 of those points can be spent on perks, though I'd recommend coming back to this after you've decided on your magical abilities.
  - Basic Set page 100 has a brief explanation of perks and some examples.
  - There are more examples of perks in GURPS Power-ups 2: Perks
  - In general, anything that provides a small bonus in certain situations, or a bigger bonus in rare situations counts as a perk.
  - Attribute Substitution, which can be used on all skills and spells, is strongly recommended.
  - The optional rule Faster Casting (Thaumatology:39) may be picked up by spending a perk on it.
  - Replacing your magical critical failure table with a variant from Thaumatology:256 is a perk.
  - Experienced players may want to pick up Spell Variation, to use Adjustable Spells (Thaumatology p39) on one spell
  - Experienced players may want to pick up Spell Enhancement, to use Adjustable Spells (Thaumatology p39) to apply an enhancement to any spell they know.

Magical Abilities
-----------------

You have 25 points to spend on magical abilities.

Spellcasting is heavily based off a player character's Intelligence (IQ), but that would limit the kind of characters you can play if the only way to do cool stuff was to be a wizard, so I have multiple ways to do magic.

Wizard
~~~~~~

A person who casts spells. Spells are a special kind of skill which takes a certain amount of time and energy (usually from fatigue points, FP) to cast. Roll against the spell's skill level to activate the spell, and then potentially roll against a different skill to deliver the spell (e.g. Innate Attack(Missile) to aim a fireball).
Spells are by default IQ/Hard skills with a bonus based on their level of the Magery advantage.
Spells are divided into a large number of colleges (see the table of contents of GURPS Magic for all 24).

In this setting, wizards are naturally somewhat specialised, having higher Magery for one college than others.
i.e. if you pick a mage you will have Magery 1 [15], and Magery +1 (one college only, -40%) [6]
You may specialise in any college except Gate, but Enchant is not particularly useful.

An untrained mage (i.e. a starting player character) learns up to 4 points in spells as their brain develops. Called "babble-spells", they are easier than normal spells (i.e. they are IQ/Average difficulty), but wizards look down on using them because they sound like baby-speak instead of a dignified ancient language.
The easiest way to pick spells is to flick between GURPS Magic and GURPS Magic - Spell Charts.

I am explicitly allowing any wizard to use the Trading Energy for Skill option from GURPS Thaumatology, page 39 (tl;dr, use the Extra Energy bonuses from Ceremonial Magic in Basic Set p238 for all spellcasting)

Mage
~~~~

A person who uses magical abilities, which aren't necessarily spells. Wizards may also learn non-spell magical abilities later.

A magical ability is any ability built out of advantages in GURPS that has the (magical, -10%) limitation applied to it.
e.g. a magical missile could be built as Innate Attack (crushing) 2 (Magical, -10%) [9].

Since this flexibility isn't very helpful, feel free to ask me or find inspiration from:
* GURPS Thaumatology:Sorcery, starting from page 12.
* GURPS Powers, sample abilities starting from page 136.
or https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/03/sorcery-spell-index.html for ideas.

Magic-resistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not particularly a magical ability, it's still more interesting than being totally mundane.
Having any level of Magic Resistance makes you unable to cast spells.
Buy as many levels as you like of:
* Damage Resistance (Magic only -20%) [4/level] - Reduces the amount of damage taken by magic attacks only
* Magic Resistance [2/level] - A penalty of -1 per level to any spell cast on you, and a +1 bonus to resist that spell.
* Spend any spare points freely.

Damage Resistance and Magic Resistance do not necessarily apply to every spell.
* A fireball is not cast *on* you, it is cast to create a projectile that's thrown at you, and so Damage Resistance reduces the damage, but there is no skill penalty or resistance bonus.
* A healing spell is cast on you, but is neither resistible, nor does it inflict damage. It would suffer a penalty from Magic Resistance, even when cast by a friend.
* Death Vision is a spell with no resistance roll that doesn't inflict damage, the skill penalty would apply, but there is no bonus to resist, and no damage to reduce.
* Dehydrate is a damaging spell that is cast on you and resisted. The caster suffers a penalty, you gain a bonus, and if you fail any damage is reduced by your levels of Damage Resistance.
