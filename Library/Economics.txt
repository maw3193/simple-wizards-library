Jobs
====

Jobs wages are dictated by Wealth level.

Starting Wealth at TL8: £20k, with a settled lifestyle that's £4k
cost of living at TL8 and Status 0: £600/mo
A Wealthy job pays £13000/mo, ~£600/day
A Comfortable wealth job pays £5200/mo, ~£240/day
An Average wealth job pays £2600/mo, ~£120/day
A Struggling job pays £1300/mo, ~£60/day
A Poor job pays £520/mo, ~£25/day

Teaching economics
==================

A teacher might accept a student for a variety of reasons. Typically, most teachers will accept proof you're doing Good Deeds.
More mercenary teachers may require £200 per spell.
Necromancy teachers don't necessarily require good deeds or money, but you must submit a blood sample that'll be used to track you if you don't check in regularly.

Paut Economics
==============

Rough recommendation for Thaumatology is 1/30th of starting wealth, making it £666.66 per dose. This isn't economical for enchanting, or much of anything else, really.
Fwush are selling it at £10 per dose, somehow.
Generally, hoard powerstones and cast Lend Energy if you need a top-up mid-adventure.


Energy Donor economics
======================

An energy donor can produce up to 48 energy per working day, and makes a daily wage of £1300/22=£59.09. That's £1.23 per energy.

Enchanting economics
====================

* A master enchanter (20 in Enchant and the spell they're enchanting, and 15 in Recover Energy) has a Comfortable wage
* A journeyman enchanter (15 in Enchant, the spell, and Recover Energy) has an Average wage
* Assume a 22 workday month (excludes weekends)
* Enchanting succeeds at least 95.47% of the time, and the cost of failures must be accounted for.

Slow and Sure
-------------

Slow and Sure doesn't benefit from a master enchanter. normally it will have groups of 2 or 3 journeyman enchanters with skil 16 or 17.
The number of enchanters makes projects more feasible in length, but doesn't affect the cost per unit.
Labour cost per energy point is £2600 / 0.9547 / 22 = £123.79/energy

Quick and Dirty
---------------
Add
tl;dr £1.25 per point of energy

An enchanting circle is 1 master and 5 assistants. The master is an Enchanting specialist, and the assistants are natural Technomancers.
Each enchanter is worth a Comfortable wealth level. They are all assisted by Struggling energy donors (though typically supplemented by volunteers.

The circle's work is worth 5200*6+1300*6=£39'000 per month. Daily labour costs are £1772.72.
The assistants draw 30 energy from Mains each, guaranteeing an energy limit of 210, though power stones may extend this in exceptional circumstances.
The cost of Mains is assumed to be small enough to be absorbed by rounding up.
Eight cycles of 210 energy per day is 1680 per day, meaning £1.054 per energy. Rounding up to a handy number is £1.25 per point of energy.

An enchantment that requires more energy can be supplemented with powerstones. Since one point of powerstone energy costs 1/1000 of the powerstone that has enough capacity (i.e. to reach 300 energy enchantments, an extra 90 energy needs to be supplied, 15 per enchanter, at £4.125 per point, for a total enchantment cost of £633.75, might as well round it to £650).
400 enchantment is £4113.50+262.50 = £4376
250 enchantment is £262.50 + £1035*6/1000 = ~£270

Industrial Enchanting
---------------------

A magical production line has a large initial outlay, but subsequently increases productivity to 10 energy per mage-day. that brings costs down to £12.38. Round it to £12.50 because that's easier.

Industrial enchanting is more cost-effective when 12.50 * N <= 262.5 + (N-210)*P(N-210/6), i.e. 415+ energy for the enchantment.

Ensorcelment
============

Ensorcelment has a listed cost of 200 per point, but easily discounts to 20 per point for something easily broken.
Wisdom 1: 4*20*1.25=£100
Wisdom 2: 8*20*1.25=£200
Wisdom 3: 12*20=240, 210*1.25 + Powerstone(5)*30/1000 = 262.50+18.6=£281.10
Wisdom 4: 16*20=320, 262.50 + Powerstone(19)*110/1000 = 262.50 + 6695*110/1000 = £998.95
Wisdom 5: 20*20=400, 262.50 + Powerstone(32)*190/1000 = £4377.90

Powerstone economics
====================

The cost of buying a powerstone differs from GURPS Magic, since it's £1.25 per point of energy. the enchanting costs £25 instead of $20, so take the listed costs at Magic p.20, and add £5 per capacity.
One point of powerstone energy costs 1/1000 of the powerstone that has enough capacity. A "standard" 15-point powerstone costs £4.125 per point.

Enchanted Item Rental
=====================

Fwush offers magic item rental, too. 5-year terms at 20% interest, paid monthly. N/60*1.2, or N/50.
a £10k item can be rented for £200 a month for 5 years.

Scroll economics
================

**REVISIT THIS**: Are scrolls too expensive?

Two tiers, an actual standard skill of 15 is an Average job paying £2600/mo.
Sub-standard scrolls are still useful for anything without a resistance roll, but pay for a Struggling job at £1300/mo.
Assuring skill 15 is £123.79 per point of energy that the spell costs to cast.
Sub-standard is £60 (£59.09 precisely) per point of energy, but at a skill level of 1d+9 where required.

Grimoire economics
==================

Thaumatology lists the cost of grimoires at 2% of campaign starting wealth per spell, assuming it must list all prerequisites. That's £400 per spell, mind you.
This doesn't help define how much text is involved in a spell, how that affects weight, etc. So I'd be better off using Dungeon Fantasy and modifying it for modern tech.
A DF spellbook is a primer costing $100 per spell and weighing 3lbs, but giving no indication for how much text is involved. Try Technomancer?
Technomancer's basic magic list is the Berkeley Grimoire (AKA Basic Textbook of Magical Formulae). 8 volumes.
They also have the Working Handbook of Applied Thaumaturgy (collection of all known spells). 22 volumes.
Supposedly, it takes 20'000 words to fully describe a spell.
A grimoire needs countermeasures to stop it being accessed by Mundanes. Dunno what, since Encrypt is *expensive*! If at all feasible, it's a state subsidy.

The Basic Grimoire
------------------
10 Air
9 Body
5 comm
8 Earth
7 Enchantment
11 Fire
7 Healing
6 Knowledge
4 Light
2 Meta
7 Mind
6 Move
3 Prot
7 Water
92 spells, 1.84M words, 21 energy to encrypt, 2100 energy to encrypt in one go £260k of enchantment alone is *not* feasible!
£36800 for the grimoire at standard rates is also not acceptable.
Assuming utf-8 and an average of 6 characters per word, how big is the basic grimoire in data? 11.4MB, trivial!
at 275 words per page, a spell is 80 pages to fully describe.
The Basic Grimoire is split into separate books per college, and written in Faerie, a secret language which not even most makes read.

Alchemy Economics
=================

The cost of an alchemical elixir is the raw materials cost + labour costs.
Each elixir defines its materials cost and the brewing time.
tl;dr, an elixir costs £(raw materials) + £32.4 * brewing time (days).
Wisdom(+1 IQ (except spellcasting) for 1 hour, £600, 5 weeks) = £1735
Health(cures disease, +2 HP; £200, 4 weeks) = £1107
Healing(heals 1d HP or 1d FP not spent on spellcasting; $50, 1 week) = £277
Battle(adds 1d DX for 1 hour, also affected by Bravery m.134; $150, 2 weeks) = £604
Invulnerability(+3 DR for 1d+1 hours; $1000, 6 weeks) = £2361
Strength(+1d ST (not HP) for 1 hour; $100, 2 weeks) = £554

Industrial Alchemy is not widely available, so the best they can manage is a state-of-the-art alchemical laboratory, giving a TL/4 bonus (+4).
An Alchemy skill at 12 guarantees an Average income. 14 for Comfortable, 16 for Wealthy.
An Alchemist does not have to be a mage of any kind, but they must be a trusted member of the magical community.
Each elixir has its own technique, for which alchemists are assumed to be trained in, eliminating the penalty.

Optimal batch size: success chance * batch size
Optimal staffing: Highest optimal batch size possible / (1 if Average, 2 if Comfortable, 5 if Wealthy)

Average (x1)
------------
1 at 16, 1*0.9815 = 0.9815
2 at 15, 2*0.9537 = 1.9074
3 at 14, 3*0.9074 = 2.7222
4 at 13, 4*0.8380 = 3.352
5 at 12, 5*0.7407 = 3.7035 <- best
6 at 11, 6*0.6250 = 3.75
7 at 10, 7*0.5 = 3.5
8 at 9, 8*0.3750 = 3

Comfortable (x2)
----------------

3 at 16 = 2.9445
4 at 15 = 3.8148
5 at 14 = 4.537
6 at 13 = 5.028
7 at 12 = 5.1849 <- best
8 at 11 = 5

Wealthy (x5)
------------

5 at 16 = 4.9075
6 at 15 = 5.7222
7 at 14 = 6.3518
8 at 13 = 6.704 <- best
9 at 12 = 6.6663
10 at 11 = 6.25

---

Conclusion: an Average wage attracting alchemists who on average produce 3.7035 elixirs per batch.

Labour cost is £120/day * brew time (days) / average batch size
e.g. paut takes 10 days to brew, so that's £120 * 10 / 3.7035 = £324.01..., rounds to £325
The fact that it costs £200 in raw materials means Fwüsh is doing one hell of a bargain.

Industrial Alchemy
---

Industrial Alchemy lets you make a batch of 1000 for a -4 penalty, but can't be used in conjunction with the TL/2 bonus.

Average (x1) at 8, success 0.2593*1000 = 259 average batch size, 259 adjusting for wages
Comfortable (x2) at 10, success 0.5*1000 = 500 average batch size, 250 adjusting for wages
Wealthy (x5) at 12, success 0.625*1000 = 625 average batch size, 125 adjusting for wages

Low pay wins out again! At least that's not true for Struggling wages...
Paut's wage bill is £120*10 / 259 = £4.633

Resurrection
============

Resurrection costs 300 energy and takes 2 hours. Unfortunately, since it's not an enchantment, the ceremonial casting takes 10x the listed time. Mages working together ceremonially is 20 hours, an absolutely gruelling ceremony. lmao at doing it with a single powerstone, though.
£1.25*250, minimum mundane value $10*P*P + $40*P, £635000. the enchantment energy is negligible for the power stone. £635 per energy. £635*250=£158'750

Necromancers capable of Resurrection are Wealthy. £600 per mage-day, 4 workings per day is £150 labour.
Or, 6 necromancers on gruelling shifts, £600*2.5*6=£9000 labour, +371.25
Call is £9500 for a resurrection.
